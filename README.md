# garrettreed.info

A static website. Currently hosted on netlify.

## To-Do

-   Spotify or Last.fm for listening
-   Goodreads for reading
-   Github and/or Gitlab for work maybe?
-   Blog
-   Replace `data.json` with Netlify CMS
-   Probably disable asset rev build step, but read more into [netlify caching first](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/). Otherwise, add cache control headers.
